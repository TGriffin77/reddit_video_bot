# Reddit Video Bot
---
This program was created to automate the collection and editting process of short-term videos that featured reddit posts and comments. With the usage of Reddit's api, some webscraping, and video editting softwares, this project was made possible.

# The Problem
The project was in the works right before Reddit's API change in April of 2023. This API change had effectively rendered this project useless as I could no longer work on this project without an authenticated developer account and being charged for the usage of the API. Usage of the code may not work as intended, due to this mishap and over a year of absent maintenance.

The program had not been completed yet, with just a little bit of bugs and glitches with video and speech synchorization that had to be resolved before actual results would haven been achieved.

# Acknowledgements
I, Thomas Griffin, was the sole developer of this project and felt extremely proud of my achievements, as this was one of my very first programming endeavors. This project had taught me much about API communications, image manipulation, and video editting all through the means of programming.
